# Exploring Racing Game Development: A Journey into Mathematics

## Project Overview

With this project, I aimed to get a better understanding of applying mathematical concepts to make a simple racing game. It helped me find a new appreciation for the dry maths that I learned at school. As it was the first time doing a game, I tried to make it as simple as possible and started in the terminal, as the programming gods intended. It felt better than starting, let's say, in Unity, because I did not have to learn a whole new editor but could use something familiar.

## Track Construction

The track is constructed by a vector of pairs that describe the sharpness of the bend and the length of the section.

## Car Representation

The car is made out of three prefabricated strings representing the state of turning left, right, and going straight.
