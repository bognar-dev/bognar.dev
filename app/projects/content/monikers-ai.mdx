Monikers.ai is an interactive, AI-powered version of the classic Monikers card game. Built with **React** and **Next.js**, this vibrant game allows players to generate custom card decks based on specific topics, creating endless fun with friends and teammates.

The game integrates the **Vercel AI SDK**, making it possible to dynamically generate cards on the fly based on categories you choose, such as "Movies", "Sports", and "YouTube Trends". Whether youâ€™re playing with friends or in a large group, Monikers.ai ensures every round is packed with energy, laughter, and a little bit of competition!

You can set up team-based turns, where players alternate describing and guessing the cards while the game persists in **localStorage**. The sleek **Tailwind CSS** design keeps the gameplay interface clean and vibrant, with smooth animations to enhance the experience.

Check out the **Monikers.ai** project on [GitHub](https://github.com/bognar-dev/monikers-ai) to dive into the code or visit the live version of the game at [Monikers.ai](monikers-ai.vercel.app). Let the guessing games begin!
