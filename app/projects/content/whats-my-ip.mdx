# Whats my IP

In the realm of web exploration, I embarked on a project aimed at demystifying the often mysterious world of IP addresses. 'Your IP Info' is a web application that provides users with a straightforward answer to the common question, 'What is my IP address?'

The technology stack powering this project includes Node.js and Express for server-side logic, HTML for structuring the content, and CSS with a touch of JavaScript for a clean and responsive user interface.

The project was initiated on May 15, 2023, and after months of meticulous development, it reached completion on November 30, 2023. Users can visit the project's GitHub repository for a closer look at the codebase and perhaps even contribute to its ongoing evolution.

The visual aesthetic of 'Your IP Info' is designed for simplicity and ease of use. Visitors are greeted with a clean interface that presents their public IP address along with additional details such as location, ISP, and more.

As a solo developer on this project, I took pride in creating a tool that not only serves a practical purpose but also reflects my commitment to user-centric design and efficient, clean code. 'Your IP Info' is more than just a technical endeavor; it's a digital creation that bridges the gap between the technical intricacies of IP addresses and the everyday user experience.
