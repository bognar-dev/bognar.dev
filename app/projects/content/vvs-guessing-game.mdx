Welcome to the **VVS Stations-Ratespiel** - a dynamic online game designed to challenge and entertain users with their knowledge of VVS stations. The project started on March 1, 2023, and is currently in progress.

The game features a user-friendly interface created with the power of **Next.js**, ensuring optimal performance and a seamless gaming experience. **Tailwind CSS** and **Shadcn UI** contribute to the game's visual appeal, providing a sleek and modern design.

Integrating **Mapbox**, the game offers an interactive map experience, allowing users to explore and guess VVS stations. The project's GitHub repository is open for collaboration, and contributions are welcome from the community.

As the sole developer, I am committed to crafting a game that not only tests VVS knowledge but also provides an enjoyable and educational experience. The VVS Stations-Ratespiel is not just a coding project; it's a creative endeavor that explores the fusion of technology and user-centric design.
